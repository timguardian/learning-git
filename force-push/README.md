## Force push to a remote

> :warning: **Use with extreme caution**

Commands to execute:
```git push -f origin branch_name```
```git push --force origin branch_name```

Reasons to force push:
* local version is better than the remote version
* remote version went wrong and needs repair
* versions have diverged and merging is undesirable
